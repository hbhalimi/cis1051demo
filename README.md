how to use git


The frist thing to do is to make a read me file!
This way, people know about your repository.

I made a change here!

##Subsection
If you split things into sectoins and subsections, youll seem organized and that you know what your doing.

###SubSubsection A
This is a subsubsection, I guess?

###SubSubsection B
This is another subsubsection, I guess?

#somebody uploaded something i dont have remotely?

# Section B
This is another big section
Files can sometimes create conflicts

# Section C
Of fancy, a third section
Add another line

And another change here!
